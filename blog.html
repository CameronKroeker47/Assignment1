        <ul>Questions

            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</li>
            <p>I had to learn how to publish the website. I didn't run into any roadblocks that I couldn't fix within a few minutes of trying.</p>

            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
            <p>I already knew most of the html content that we covered. However I did learn how to optimally use github desktop to work on my project from my laptop and how to publish the website. In addition to that I also have a much better understanding of what CSS is from the lectures.</p>

            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>I thought the most helpful reasource was the assignment instructions and refrencing the syntax from the code in the lectures. There were a few times I looked at the code from the lectures to make sure the structure of my code was correct.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Assignment 2</h2> <p>Date:10/24/2022</p>

        <ul>Questions

            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</li>
            <p>The day the assignment was due I was trying to fix how the images were aligned. The code I added wasn't working, so I went to my previous github save. The problem was that I hadn't commited my github repository in really long time.
            I ended up having to crunch basically 70% of the assignment, but since I had already done it I got it done much faster the second time. I learned a lesson to commit more often. The alignment of the posts and sizes of images were the biggest roadblocks in this assignment. </p>

            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
            <p>I learned a ton. Before this assignment I knew how to change the background color and the font. Now I know all sorts of CSS code to make an actual decent looking website.</p>

            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>I used a lot of W3Schools to check my syntax and feautres of CSS. I also relied on the notes from the lectures. The flex box part of the lecture was the most helpful.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Assignment 3</h2> <p>Date:11/7/2022</p>

        <ul>Questions

            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</li>
            <p>I had multiple roadblocks when trying to complete this assingment.</p>
            <p>The first roadblock that I had was getting the attribute values. I hadn't fully read the assingment instructions, so after I read throught the instruction I saw the hint for getting those values.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The second roadblock I had was with the price values for the filter feature. I understood the logic behind it, but I was comparing two different string values instead of number values. I didn't know with Javascript you should do "Number()". I will never make that mistake again</p>

            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>

            <p>I learned a ton from this assignment.</p>
            <p>This was my first time using Javascript. Refrencing user input and manipulating the DOM with Javascript was also a first. I already knew most of the logic behind filtering the posts, but it was my first time doing it in Javascript. Now that I've had some experinace with everything in this assignment I feel much more confident with what I'm able to create with my code.</p>

            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>Other than the links, the class lectures were helpful for undertstanding the fundementals of JavaScript. Using some of my past coding knowlege with the notes from lecture I was able to pick up on JavaScript pretty quick once I correctly refrenced all of the values from the site.</p>

            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
            <p>https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-check-a-radio-button-using-javascript</p>
            <p>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number</p>

            <p>I used the first link for getting the correct value from the radio input when setting the condition when making a new post.
                The second link was used to solve one of my roadblocks I mentioned earlier. I didn't know why my inequality for prices wasn't working. I found out that the type was a string, so I looked up how to change it back to a number.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Assignment 4</h2> <p>Date:11/14/2022</p>

        <ul>Questions

            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</li>
            <p>The biggest challenge I had was understanding how my code was effecting the server I was making.</p>
            <p>I didn't have a lot of experinace with servers prior to this assignment so getting use to node was a bit tricky. Using our notes from lecture and logging variables throughout the process helped significantly in this assignment.</p>

            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>

            <p>I knew nothing about server sided programming.</p>
            <p>I've had a bit of expeirance working in the console using Linux, but other than that I had to get use to running my code through a terminal. I have learned lots about node and how servers pass information, and the specific parts of url's.</p>

            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>Starting off in Node was a bit rough for me. I used the main Node site https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html to help understand how to use Node</p>

            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
            <p>I attempted to Google information on how to read information only once on a server, but was unable to find anything that I could apply to my code. I'm still a bit lost on how I would cache the data from the files so that they would only be called once.</p>
        

        </ul>


        <h2>Assignment 5</h2> <p>Date:11/28/2022</p>

        <ul>Questions

            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</li>
            <p>The biggest challenge with this assignment was getting handlebars to work on my machine. I was a bit behind on lectures since I had recently got Covid, so I only had the recorded lectures to learn. I struggled with running handlebars in my terminal until Hla told me to run it using scripts in my json. Once that worked I was able to get a responce to know if what I was doing was working. The concept of handlebars seems pretty straightforward, it was just the setup that I got stuck on for a really long time.</p>

            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</li>

            <p>I had no experiance with handlebars and little experiance with express.</p>
            <p>It was easy to think about handlebars as boxes, and we were just packaging code to use later. I'm always in favor of learning ways to not repeat code. I beleive that if I went back and installed handlebars on my older assignments then I would be much more comfortable using and applying handlebars.</p>

            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</li>
            <p>I was pretty lost on the start of the assignment until Hla had told me how to get handlebars running correctly. Hla told me that running the code in the console didn't work and I should just try the scirpts in .json. I also used the handlebars website to get a link to reference the material. Most websites weren't too helpful in this assignment. I found that the lecture notes were super helpful when understanding the concepts behind handlebars.</p>

            <li>What are one or two things you had to do an internet search for to complete the assignment?</li>
            <p>I had looked up how to set up handlebars, but the reasoruces focused more on the concept of handlebars, which I already understood.</p>
            <p>None of the resources I looked up were helpful since my biggest problem was finding a way to run handlebars. You didn't mention the second method until the next lecture.</p>
