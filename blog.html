        <ul>Questions

            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</li>
            <p>I had to learn how to publish the website. I didn't run into any roadblocks that I couldn't fix within a few minutes of trying.</p>

            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
            <p>I already knew most of the html content that we covered. However I did learn how to optimally use github desktop to work on my project from my laptop and how to publish the website. In addition to that I also have a much better understanding of what CSS is from the lectures.</p>

            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
            <p>I thought the most helpful reasource was the assignment instructions and refrencing the syntax from the code in the lectures. There were a few times I looked at the code from the lectures to make sure the structure of my code was correct.</p>
